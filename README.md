using React, Vite, and Chart.js. This dashboard will display various interactive charts (Bar, Line, Scatter, Bubble) based on data fetched from an external file. It has reusable chart components and integrates multiple charts into a single application.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
